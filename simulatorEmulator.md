# Simulation vs. Emulation

- Simulation(模擬)
  - Attempting to perform the same way, but may not 100% the same.
  - Suited for simple operation, due to the faster speed.
  - e.g. **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- Emulation(仿真)
  - Performing in the same way as another, but may not at the same speed.
  - Suited for complex operation.
  - e.g. **Eve-NG**, gNS3
